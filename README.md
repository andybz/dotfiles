# dotfiles

This is a small set of customizations that sit on top of Hashrocket's dotmatrix project which I have used for years and highly recommend.

https://github.com/hashrocket/dotmatrix

## Install

To install clone the repo and run the install script from within the dotfiles directory:

```
git clone git@github.com:biscuitvile/dotfiles.git && cd dotfiles && bin/install
```

**Note:** I don't expect anybody to use this but me really, but if you do you should really fixup your `.gitconfig.local` unless you're trying to front.

## Uninstall

To uninstall run the uninstall script from within the dotfiles directory:

```
bin/uninstall
```
